The notes here correspond to the settings defined in `vscode/settings.json`

* "editor.formatOnSave": true: This enables rubocop(if configured) to run autocorrect on your VSCode Editor. To enable this go to Code -> Preferences -> Settings & once there in the search bar type 'save' under the 'User' tab and you'll a checkbox for: "Editor: Code actions on Save". Once you check it, it will add `"editor.formatOnSave": true` to your settings.json. Once done you can test to see if that works for you.
