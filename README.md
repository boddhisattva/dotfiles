# dotfiles

* Notes specific to [Oh My ZSH](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) related dotfile

  * Some of the aliases used in the .zshrc file, specific to plugins like git etc., contain the usage of custom alias names instead of using default names specified by the plugin as they're easier to remember and frequently use as and when required.

  * To copy the say the `.zshrc` file from the repo location to where it should be actually placed to be effective, we can use the command `cp .zshrc ~/`

  * To copy it from the location where it used to the location where it is part of a git repo `cp ~/.zshrc .`(this assumes your currently within the dotfiles repo)
