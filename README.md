# dotfiles

## About

These are my personal dotfiles that I use from time to time.

## Usage

* General usage

  * In order to make your dotfile aliases work in your localbox you need to copy that dot file to your home directory. A sample
  command to do the same is - `cp .zshrc ~/`

* Some notes that specifically apply with respect to the usage of `.zshrc`

  * Some of the aliases used in the `.zshrc` file override the aliases specified as part of [oh-my-zsh plugins](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/master/plugins). I've found these custom aliases more easy to use.
